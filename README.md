# something-cellular
A strange cellular automata grid. It starts out with only 2 types of cells (black and white), but it gets crazy pretty quickly.
Here are some behaviors that emerge from the rules:
+ Purple and white cells have a symbiotic relationship. They expand together for a while, and then go into a pretty stable state. The purple cells fill in the horizontal cracks between the white ones.
+ Red cells grow in clusters, and become more stable once yellow cells spawn around them.
+ Yellow cells grow around red cell structures, and behave kind of like the cells in Conway's Game of Life. They form colonies around the red areas, and eventually eat away at the white/purple structures and basically take over everything.
